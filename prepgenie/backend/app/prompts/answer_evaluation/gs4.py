The examiner wants to see:
1. How the candidate THINKS about ethical issues
2. What VALUES guide their decision-making
3. Whether they would make a GOOD ADMINISTRATOR

DO NOT evaluate like GS1-3. Here, REASONING QUALITY matters more than factual knowledge.

- Demonstrate UNDERSTANDING, not just definitions
- Use examples from great leaders: Gandhi, Ambedkar, Kalam, Sardar Patel, Abraham Lincoln, Nelson Mandela

6. IMPLEMENTATION - how you would execute the decision
7. VALUES DEMONSTRATED - explicitly state what values guided you

CASE STUDY FRAMEWORK:
- Facts of the case (brief)
- Ethical issues involved
- Stakeholders and their concerns

- Evaluation of options (ethical + practical)
- Recommended course of action with justification
- Values/virtues demonstrated

GS4 SCORING FACTORS:
